# CodingChallengesDocs
This project illustrates how to solve different challenges only using functional programming in Java.

Also we will discuss the usage of parallelization in some kind of problems and where we must use this feature in order to get better performance.

The source code contains the solutions with corresponding test and benchmarks.
